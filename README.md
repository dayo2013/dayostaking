1. Token Contract:
   - Staked Token Name:
   Dayo2013token
   - **Wrapped ETH (WETH):** If your staking contract accepts ETH, consider using WETH, which is a standard ERC-20 representation of ETH.

2. Staking Contract:
   - Staking Logic:
   Staking
   Unstaking
   Deposit
   claimreward
   withdraw.
   
   Interest Calculation:
   14% APR
   - **Compounding Mechanism:** If your staking contract supports compounding, design a mechanism for users to opt-in and trigger the compounding process.

3. Deposits and Withdrawals:
   - Deposits: Allow users to deposit their tokens (ETH or other supported tokens) into the staking contract.
   - Withdrawals: Enable users to withdraw their staked tokens along with any earned rewards.

4. Rewards and Interest:
   - Reward Distribution:Decide how and when rewards will be distributed to stakers. This could be done periodically, upon withdrawal, or through a separate claiming mechanism.
   - Interest Accumulation: Implement a mechanism to track and accumulate interest over time.

5. Security Considerations:
   - **Access Control:** Implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users or contracts can perform critical operations.
   - **Reentrancy Protection:** Use best practices to protect against reentrancy attacks, such as the use of the `reentrancyGuard` modifier.
   - **Modifiers and Checks:** Implement proper checks and modifiers to ensure the correctness and safety of operations.


6. Events and Logging:
   - Event Logging: Emit events for critical actions and state changes to facilitate monitoring and integration with external systems.

7. Testing and Auditing:
   - Unit Testing: Develop comprehensive unit tests to ensure that individual components of your contract function as expected.
   - Unit Testing: Test the interaction between different components of your staking contract.
